    <h1>Oh my, this is the news </h1>
    <h2>And this is less important header</h2>
    <p>Story of this chapter is not as pleasing as Harry Potter's plot, is it?</p>
    <h2>This is even less important header than the one before</h2>
    <p>Lets talk about number of dinosaurs you once wondered you could ride on. Was it 1? Was it 10? It's never been
        about the size
        but the quality of the optional ride, right? Probably you said that quietly under your cheeky nose.Well that's
        it love. Break is over. </p>
    <h3>This is actually not even as half as important as the paragraph that will be stated under it but let's do
        it! </h3>
